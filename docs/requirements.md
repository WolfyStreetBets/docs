# WOLFY Requirement

## What is it?

If you want to use WolfyStreetBets, you'll first have to authenticate using your Web3 Wallet (e.g. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)).   

The authentication works by checking your WOLFY Token balance. If you have at least $250 worth of WOLFY, you will be able to access the dApp.   

See the steps below for authenticating.

## Why do I need to authenticate?

There is a minimum WOLFY Token holding requirement for using WolfyStreetBets strictly to benefit WOLFY holders, and adoption of the WOLFY Token.    
This ensures all parts of the WolfyStreetBets ecosystem work harmoniously in a complementary fashion.    

Other than being the front-door pass to WolfyStreetBets, we are working on other applications for the WOLFY Token - both internal to the ecosystem and also external.
