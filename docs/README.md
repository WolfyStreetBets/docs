## Overview

At WolfyStreetBets, we're passionate about DeFi. That's why each part of our ecosystem is DeFi-centric - with focus on: longevity, holder benefits &amp; accessibility.   

Currently, our ecosystem looks like this:   

* **WOLFY Token** - A hyper-deflationary, reflection-yielding ERC-20 Token. Audited by Solidity Finance. [0x7dbbcae15d4db168e01673400d7844870cc1e36f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7dbbcae15d4db168e01673400d7844870cc1e36f)   
    * 2% of every transaction is auto-distributed to holders, upon transaction. AKA Reflection/Frictionless Yield.
    * 1% of every transaction is burned forever.
* **WolfyStreetBets** - Prediction Market dApp. Smart Contract audit by Halborn Security.
    * **Stake** in decentralized prediction markets such as DeFi vs CeFi, TSLA vs ETH with risk profile options &amp; zero gas fees.
    * **Supply Liquidity** to our decentralized pools in return for a dynamic APR (risk of IL).
    * **Perform Analysis** using our charts, news resources and more.

## Development

We're currently working on:

* **WOLFY DAO** - Achieving 100% decentralization through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. WOLFYDAO Token &amp; WOLFY Token will be the core drivers of proposals, voting &amp; future developments.
* **Multi-chain Integration** - Analysing which blockchain to integrate with WolfyStreetBets next. Some of the factors we take into consideration include: user base, compatibility &amp; UX.
* **More Prediction Markets** - Analysing and configuring data sources &amp; smart contracts for more prediction options, such as 24hr pools, side-choosing &amp; more.
* **Research** - Researching the market and coordinating new partnerships.
